# CS4640IndentationFixer
Fixes your matlab indentations when copying from pdf to matlab

Not super sure why I made this, but I was tired of constantly fixing indentation when copying from matlab

To run it, call Entry (main function) with 2 arguments, first argument is path to file with raw text (copied from pdf), 
second one is output file (formatted text)


... Probably was not worth making this timewise, but if anyone else uses it then it might be worth it
